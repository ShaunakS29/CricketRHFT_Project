# CricketRHFT_Project
Project on cricket match and player analysis

26th August 2022

This project was done as part of my dissertation at the University of Strathclyde.

Cricket is one of the most popular sports in the world.  It associates itself with multiple numeric statistics which in turn provides ample scope to explore different analytical approaches. Women’s domestic cricket tournaments have gained immense popularity and Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy, a women’s cricket domestic tournament of England is one such tournament, recently started in 2020. The tournament is conducted in the 50 over format. Available data from the years 2020 and 2021 were used to study and statistically analysed to draw inferences on significance of factors contributing to winning cricket matches. The data relating to the 2020 and 2021 seasons of the tournament was fetched mostly from cricsheet.org website and a few portions taken from Wikipedia. The data was in the form of comma-separated values(csv). 

This project puts its focus on match data of the 2020 and 2021 seasons and analyses various aspects of batting and bowling. The impact of toss, runs scored by teams, runs scored by individual players, batting partnerships, strike rates, wickets, economy rates, etc have been studied and thoroughly observed for insights.  Top performing players of every team were identified and their impact for team performances were looked into. Using results of exploratory analysis, attempts were made using machine learning algorithms to find ways to predict the winning team of a match and the total runs of a team batting second. Both classification and regression approaches have been explored and their results were validated with the actual results of the 16 matches that have been already played till 23rd July for the 2022 edition of the tournament.

The analysis inclusive of visualization and modelling was primarily done using Python 3.8 programming language along with associated libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Scikit-Learn. Microsoft Excel was used for some data investigation and preparation.
